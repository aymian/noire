# NOIRE Project Rules

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React with Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Glassmorphism theme)
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Auth**: Firebase (Identity) + Supabase (Email Verification)
- **Database**: Firestore (User profiles)

## UI/UX Standards
- Maintain the "premium dark" aesthetic (hsl(220 20% 5%))
- Use `glass-noire` utility for blurred backgrounds
- Always include entry animations for pages using Framer Motion
- UI must be responsive and scroll-free on main auth pages

## Code Practices
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Keep services (Firebase, Supabase) in `src/lib`
- Always handle loading and error states for async operations
- Use meaningful console logs for debugging in dev environment

## Verification Flow
1. Signup via Firebase
2. Profile creation in Firestore
3. Verification link sent via Supabase
4. Land on `/onboarding` for auto-verification update in Firestore
